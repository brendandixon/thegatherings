# The Gatherings

## The Struggle of Managing Groups

*The Gatherings* is an open-source project intended to address a single problem
common in many churches: Managing their community of groups.

Many churches promote "small groups" of varying kinds: Weekly nights in homes,
Sunday classes, weekend outing groups, and more. All of these and each of these
are useful in promoting community and impacting community.

But managing these groups is work. And the problem gets worse as a church does
better. With each new group the net of relationships widens and thickens. It is
difficult to know which groups are healthy and which are struggling. It is hard
to know how well they cover the church's geographic area. Even leaders of the
groups have challenges. They can lose sight of who's been regular and who's been
irregular.

Connecting people also requires constant time and attention. Groups have
lifespans and membership often changes. Finding groups, either for those new
to the church or those who switching for one reason or another, is difficult,
often requiring updates to the church's main website.

Some solutions exist, but they come as part of a full-church office suite. By
focusing on everything, they lose the focus on the one thing. Choosing a
solution impacts, not just managing groups, but all aspects of church life.
And, as churches grow, they can get expensive.

## The Goal of this Project

*The Gatherings* will addresses all of these and more. And it will do so
through an open-source approach. Churches can set-up and run
*The Gatherings* on their own computers or host it inexpensively in the
"cloud" (such as [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) or
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).
