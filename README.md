## The Struggle of Managing Groups

*theGatherings* is an open-source project intended to address a common problem common in
churches: Managing their community of groups.

Churches often community groups of varying kinds: Weekly nights in homes, Sunday classes, weekend
outing groups, and more. All of these and each of these are useful in promoting and impacting
community. But managing these groups is work. And the problem gets worse as a church does better.
With each new group the net of relationships widens and thickens. It is difficult to know which
groups are healthy and which are struggling. It is hard to know how well they cover the church's
geographic area. Even leaders of the groups have challenges. They can lose sight of who's been
regular and who's been irregular.

Connecting people also requires constant time and attention. Groups have lifespans and membership
often changes. Finding groups, either for those new to the church or those switching for one reason
or another, is difficult. Maintaining the list of active groups often requires updates to the
church's main website.

Some solutions exist, but they come as part of a full-church office suite. By focusing on
everything, they lose the focus on the one thing. Choosing a solution impacts, not just managing
groups, but all aspects of church life. And, as churches grow, the full-suite can get expensive.

## The Goals of this Project

*theGatherings* will address all of these and more. *theGatherings* will exist in two forms: A
free-to-use hosted form and as an open-source platform sophisticated Churches may download and
deploy. *theGatherings* will have a "zero-height" bar to adoption. Churches will only have to
choose *if* they want to use *theGatherings.*
