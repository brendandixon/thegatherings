## The Struggle of Managing Groups

*The Gatherings* is an open-source project intended to address just one problem common in many
churches: Managing their community of groups.

Many churches promote "community groups" of varying kinds: Weekly nights in homes, Sunday classes,
weekend outing groups, and more. All of these and each of these are useful in promoting community
and impacting community.

But managing these groups is work. And the problem gets worse as a church does better. With each new
group the net of relationships widens and thickens. It is difficult to know which groups are healthy
and which are struggling. It is hard to know how well they cover the church's geographic area. Even
leaders of the groups have challenges. They can lose sight of who's been regular and who's been
irregular.

Connecting people also requires constant time and attention. Groups have lifespans and membership
often changes. Finding groups, either for those new to the church or those switching for one reason
or another, is difficult. Maintaining the list of active groups often requires updates to the
church's main website.

Some solutions exist, but they come as part of a full-church office suite. By focusing on
everything, they lose the focus on the one thing. Choosing a solution impacts, not just managing
groups, but all aspects of church life. And, as churches grow, the full-suite can get expensive.

## The Goals of this Project

*The Gatherings* will address all of these and more. *The Gatherings* will exist in two forms: A
free-to-use hosted form and as an open-source platform sophisticated Churches may download and
deploy. *The Gatherings* will have a "zero-height" bar to adoption. Churches will only have to
choose *if* they want to use *The Gatherings.*
